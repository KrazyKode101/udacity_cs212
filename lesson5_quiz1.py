# Write the two action functions, hold and roll. Each should take a
# state as input, apply the appropriate action, and return a new
# state.
#
# States are represented as a tuple of (p, me, you, pending) where
# p:       an int, 0 or 1, indicating which player's turn it is.
# me:      an int, the player-to-move's current score
# you:     an int, the other player's current score.
# pending: an int, the number of points accumulated on current turn, not yet scored
other = {1:0,0:1}

    """Apply the hold action to a state to yield a new state:
    Reap the 'pending' points and it becomes the other player's turn."""
    # your code here
    p, me, you, pending = state
    return (other[p], you, me+pending, 0)

def roll(state, d):
    """Apply the roll action to a state (and a die roll d) to yield a new state:
    If d is 1, get 1 point (losing any accumulated 'pending' points),
    and it is the other player's turn. If d > 1, add d to 'pending' points."""
